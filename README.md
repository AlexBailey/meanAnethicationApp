# meanAnethicationApp
Simple MEAN Stack Authentication App using JSON Web Tokens

This website is just a polish up exercise for me, it will allow users to register an account, login and logout. It will also check to see whether or not a user is logged in or not in order to access certain parts of the site. Futher features will be added, but for now I'm keeping it simple.

This projects will feature REST API (Node.js/Express), CORS, MongoDB(Mongoose), Angular 2, Angular2-JWT and Auth Guard + much more...
